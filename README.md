# Integrated Data Visualization Dashboard for Anomaly Detection and Analysis using Clinical Audit Report

# Overview
This project, developed during Hackfest 2024 - Novo Nordisk, focuses on integrating data from various formats into a more readable, analyzable form and providing visual tools to enhance anomaly detection. By leveraging dynamic dashboards and visualization tools, we aim to improve data readability, analysis, and insights extraction, especially in domains like audit trails, compliance, and user activity tracking.

# Objectives
**The key goals of the project include:**
1. Understanding the domain: Gaining insights into the specific data formats and their applications.
2. Data Collection: Collecting diverse datasets for comprehensive analysis.
3. Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and structuring the data to make it suitable for analysis.
4. Data Visualization: Visualizing data composition and trends.
5. Dynamic Dashboard Creation: Building a dashboard to dynamically visualize data and detect anomalies.

# Tools
1. Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab): For data preprocessing and analysis.
2. PowerBI: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

# Data Components
**The project integrates several data formats, focusing on:**
1. Audit and Compliance
2. User Activity Tracking
3. Study and Site Management
4. Data Integrity
5. Workflow

# The general workflow of the project follows:
1. Collection and preprocessing of multi-format data.
2. Visualization of user actions and time-based data from audit trails.
3. Anomaly detection using dynamic dashboards.

# Applications
**The insights gained from this project can be applied in both industrial and academic settings, such as:**
1. Clinical data handling
2. Compliance and audit reporting
3. Data integrity monitoring

# Key Takeaways
